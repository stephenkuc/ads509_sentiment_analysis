    "#### Q: Overall, which artist has the higher average sentiment per song? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: For these first 20 songs of each artist's career, Frank Turner has a slightly higher average sentiment per songs than Tom Petty. Honestly, it's pretty interesting that Frank's are more positive, where I would think he is slightly more negative, especially in his earlier days. There's also a chance that since Tom uses more frequent words, that his words fell more into the overall lexicon than Franks, and were then scored more often.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Q: For your first artist, what are the three songs that have the highest and lowest sentiments? Print the lyrics of those songs to the screen. What do you think is driving the sentiment score? \n",
    "\n",
    "(Code and printed lyrics are above)\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Frank Turner:\n",
    "    \n",
    "   3 highest: \"Photosynthesis\", \"A Decent Cup of Tea\", and \"The Ladies of London Town\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "   3 Lowest: \"Love, Ire and Song\", \"Must Try Harder\", and \"Once we were Anarchists.\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing these songs, Photosynthesis makes sense to be one of the more positive songs. Althouogh, when looking at the lyrics, there are mentions of death, wasted time, sleepless nights, and others; but it does have a tinge of positive with words like marriage, friends, family, dreams, and negation of possibly bad things, which isn't taken into account with the lexicon approach (\"I won't shut up\", \"I won't sit down\").\n",
    " \n",
    "On the negative side, \"Love, Ire, and Song\" is a song about growing up, getting let down, and being disappointed at how the world turned out to be; yet it does end positively, and listening to it fully, it could be considered a slightly optimistic song (brilliant song, IMO). Since the majority of the song is negative, then it has an overall negative rating. There are many negative words like \"disgust\", \"disappointment\", \"defeat\", \"killed\", \"idiot\", \"sinking\", \"pain\", and the list goes on, are all included. There are swears as well. This reminds me of the \"thwarted expectations\" example given in this week's presentation, except as opposite. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these songs didn't seem to range too high positively or too low negative overall. This makes sense to me, as his songs tend to be more from a realist type of perspective, that while most may be negative to some degree, there is some optimism taken out in the end.\n",

    "\n",
    "(Code and printed lyrics are above)\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Tom Petty:\n",
    "    \n",
    "   3 highest: \"I Need To Know\", \"Rockin Around with You\", and \"Baby's a Rock and Roller\"\n",
    "   3 lowest: \"Restless\", Fooled Again\", and \"hurt\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "Tom's lyrics are much more rock and rolly, and more simple than Frank's. There are a lot of repeated words -- all these songs utilize the song name in the chorus. The positive song titles seem to be a bit more positive, while negative are more negative, so that usage must be driving the score a bit. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"I need to know\", though, is perhaps a more negative song in the end, as it's about someone possibly leaving a relationship. The rest of the positive songs do seem like positive songs, with a lot of use of the word \"babe\" or \"baby\". Still their overall scores are in the negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The low songs all make sense, at least in terms of how the lexicon works. \"fooled again\" uses the word \"Fool\" a lot, although the verses are a bit sarcastic (seem positive, but are negative), but since this doesn't take context into situation, as there is a lot of negation. \"Hurt\" uses the word \"Hurt\" a lot, as mentioned; aside from these song titles, it's hard to see other words that are strongly positive or negative.\n",
